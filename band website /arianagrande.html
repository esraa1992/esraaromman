        Ariana Grande-Butera, born June 26, 1993, is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She began her career in 2008 in the Broadway musical 13, before playing the role of Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series Victorious and in the spinoff Sam & Cat. She has also appeared in other theatre and television roles and has lent her voice to animated television and films. <br>

        Grande's music career began in 2011 with the soundtrack Music from Victorious. In 2013, she released her first studio album, Yours Truly, which debuted atop the US Billboard 200. The album's lead single, "The Way", debuted in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, with critics comparing her wide vocal range to that of Mariah Carey. Grande's second studio album, My Everything (2014), entered at number one in the US and charted inside the top 10 in several other countries. With the album's lead single "Problem" and several other successful singles, Grande continuously charted inside the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 for 34 weeks and had the most top 10 singles of any artist in 2014. The following year, she went on her first world tour, The Honeymoon Tour, to promote My Everything. <br>
        
        In 2016, Grande released her third studio album, Dangerous Woman, which peaked at number two on the Billboard 200. Its title track debuted at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100, making Grande the first person in the history of that chart to have the lead singles from each of their first three albums debut within the top 10 in the US.[3] In 2017, Grande embarked on her international Dangerous Woman Tour in support of the album. She released her fourth studio album, Sweetener, in August 2018. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and in a number of foreign markets. That year, she topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the first time with "Thank U, Next".[4]
